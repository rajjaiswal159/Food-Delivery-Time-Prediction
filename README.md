🚚 Food Delivery Time Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the estimated time of arrival (ETA) for food deliveries using machine learning regression models. The goal is to build a reliable model that can predict delivery time based on various features like distance, weather, traffic, and delivery person characteristics.

📌 Problem Statement
Given a dataset containing various features of food deliveries (e.g., distance, weather, delivery person ratings), the task is to predict the time taken for food delivery. This can help food delivery platforms optimize routing, customer expectations, and resource allocation.

📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes the following features:

Delivery_person_Age

Delivery_person_Ratings

Distance(km)

Type_of_order

Type_of_vehicle

Weather

Road_traffic_density

multiple_deliveries

Time_taken(min) (Target)

🧹 Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values.

Applied encoding to categorical features.

Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler.

Combined transformations using ColumnTransformer.

🧠 Models Used
Several machine learning models were evaluated:

Linear Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Optuna for hyperparameter tuning

📈 Evaluation Metrics
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

R² Score

Cross-Validation Score

🔍 Key Highlights
Conducted detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.

Identified strong patterns and relationships (e.g., between distance and time taken).

Performed model tuning using Optuna for better results.

Visualized residuals to check prediction errors and bias.

✅ Results
The best-performing model yielded:

MAE ≈ 5 minutes

R² Score ≈ 42%

MAPE ≈ 24%

🚀 Future Work
Experiment with advanced models like XGBoost or LightGBM.

Incorporate feature engineering (e.g., delivery zones, time of day).

Try NLP-based feature extraction if textual data is available (e.g., instructions, addresses).

Improve model explainability with SHAP or LIME.
