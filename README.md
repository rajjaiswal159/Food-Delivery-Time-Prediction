# 🚚 Food Delivery Time Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the estimated time of arrival (ETA) for food deliveries using machine learning regression models. The goal is to build a reliable model that can predict delivery time based on various features like distance, weather, traffic, and delivery person characteristics.

# 📌 Problem Statement
Given a dataset containing various features of food deliveries (e.g., distance, weather, delivery person ratings), the task is to predict the time taken for food delivery. This can help food delivery platforms optimize routing, customer expectations, and resource allocation.

# 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes the following features:

 • Delivery_person_Age

 • Delivery_person_Ratings

 • Distance(km)

 • Type_of_order

 • Type_of_vehicle

 • Weather

 • Road_traffic_density

 • multiple_deliveries

 • Time_taken(min) (Target)

# 🧹 Data Preprocessing
 • Handled missing values.

 • Applied encoding to categorical features.

 • Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler.

 • Combined transformations using ColumnTransformer.

# 🧠 Models Used
Several machine learning models were evaluated:

 • Linear Regression

 • K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

 • Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

 • Decision Tree Regressor

 • Random Forest Regressor

 • Optuna for hyperparameter tuning

# 📈 Evaluation Metrics
 • Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

 • R² Score

 • Cross-Validation Score

# ✅ Results
 • The best-performing model yielded:

 • MAE ≈ 5 minutes

 • R² Score ≈ 82%
